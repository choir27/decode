# Decode
Write better tutorials that flow like stories. Provide full, complete code examples without overwhelming readers.

## Running this project
You can run this project by running:
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Adding Markdown and Code

A new route is created for each folder under `app/stories/flows`.

Each route renders the markdown of `app/stories/flows/[route-name]/story.md`.

Code referenced by the markdown should be under `app/stories/flows/[route-name]/code/`.

Find an example under `app/stories/flows/pinia-stores`.
