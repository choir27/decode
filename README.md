## Adding Markdown and Code

A new route is created for each folder under `app/stories/flows`.

Each route renders the markdown of `app/stories/flows/[route-name]/story.md`.

Code referenced by the markdown should be under `app/stories/flows/[route-name]/code/`.

Fine an example under `app/stories/flows/pinia-stores`.
